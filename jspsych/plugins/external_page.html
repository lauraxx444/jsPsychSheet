            <p class="consent-text-block">Please read this document carefully before you decide to participate in this research study. <b>Your
                participation is voluntary, and you can decline to participate, or withdraw consent at any time,
                with no consequences.  You must be 18 years or older to participate in this experiment.</b>

            <p class="consent-header">Study Title:</p>
            <p>Perceptual Metacognition and Personality Traits</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Person(s) conducting the research:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Brian Odegaard, Assistant Professor, Department of Psychology 
                Email: bodegaard@ufl.edu

            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Purpose of the research study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively you can perceive perceptual items, to 
                evaluate how you rate confidence in what you have seen, and to assess personality traits.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">What you will be asked to do in the study: </p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do the following things: (1) sit in front of a computer 
                monitor to detect briefly-presented visual items and rate confidence in what you have seen; (2) Fill out 
                responses on a few personality trait inventories.  All responses in this experiment will be completely 
                anonymous.  
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Time required:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">One session, which can last up to 60 Minutes</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Risks and benefits:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants
                would not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar
                studies have been conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard and there have never been 
                any reported instances of discomfort. There are no direct benefits of participation to you, but you will be 
                contributing to scientific knowledge about how visual information is encoded and remembered.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Confidentiality:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a 
                code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your 
                responses will be completely anonymous.  Your name will not be used in any report.

                Only the researchers will have access to the information we collect online. There is a minimal risk that 
                security of any online data may be breached, but since no identifying information will be collected, and 
                the online host (Prolific) uses several forms of encryption other protections, it is unlikely that a security 
                breach of the online data will result in any adverse consequence for you.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Compensation & Withdrawal Policy:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">You will be compensated $6 for successful completion of the study.  You may choose to withdraw 
                from the experiment at any point, and <b>we also reserve the right to terminate your session at any 
                time, due to task negligence or inattentive behavior.</b> For example, if you input the same response for 
                10 or more questions in a row, or fail to input responses for 10 or more questions in a row, we will 
                terminate your session.  Should you choose to withdraw (or should your session be terminated), you 
                will be paid for the total amount of time you participated at a rate of $6/hr.  For example, if you 
                participated for 15 minutes and then stopped, you would be paid $1.50 for participating. Note, however, 
                that if you withdraw, or if your session is terminated, you will not be eligible for the bonus payment. 
                Additionally, you will need to email notifying the experimenters of when you participated 
                (paclab@psych.ufl.edu).  Please include the day and time in the email) so you can be manually 
                compensated through the payment system. <b>We will not pay beyond 60 minutes of participation, as 
                this experiment should be completed in about 60 minutes.</b>
